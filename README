wallpicker has the ability to randomize your wallpaper selection

Upon running randomBG.sh, it makes a shuffled list from all the images (files
for now, actually) in a given folder or checks if one exists, once this list 
is prepared it takes the first image in the list and sets it as your wallpaper. 

For now it is capable of checking if files and directories exist but it is not
capable of selecting only viewable images, so make sure the files in the 
wallpaper location are all suitable images. The default wallpaper location is
in ~/Pictures/Wallpapers and can be changed using the wallpicker.conf

To have wallpicker select a background for you on a regular interval, use a 
cron service like cronie and add a line like this to your crontab

# Change background every ten minutes
